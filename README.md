# clarifai2-go
Clarifai is a business that provides a set of APIs to analyze images/videos.  This repo contains golang codes to access those APIs.  It's similar to Google Cloud Vision, Amazon Rekognition, and Microsoft Computer Vision.  For the details of the Clarifai API, [get to their web sites](https://clarifai.com/developer/).

## Status
* Supports simple functions only. A framework to implement all the functions are implemented.  
* You can send your images/videos to Clarifai to obtain tags, and store your images/videos on Clarifai.
* Sanity checking can be done by running "go test".  Don't forget adding your own API key before doing so.

## Next task
Add a support for seaching images/videos.
